""" A neural chatbot using sequence to sequence model with
attentional decoder.

This is based on Google Translate Tensorflow model
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/translate/

Sequence to sequence model by Cho et al.(2014)

Created by Chip Huyen as the starter code for assignment 3,
class CS 20SI: "TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research"
cs20si.stanford.edu

This file contains the code to run the model.

See readme.md for instruction on how to run the starter code.

This implementation learns NUMBER SORTING via seq2seq. Number range: 0,1,2,3,4,5,EOS
